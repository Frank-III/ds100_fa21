    "# The Cook County Assessor's Office\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you’ll be working with comes from the Cook County Assessor’s Office (CCAO) in Illinois, a government institution that determines property taxes across most of Chicago’s metropolitan area and its nearby suburbs. In the United States, all property owners are required to pay property taxes, which are then used to fund public services including education, road maintenance, and sanitation. These property tax assessments are based on property values estimated using statistical models that consider multiple factors, such as real estate value and construction cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system, however, is not without flaws. In late 2017, a lawsuit was filed against the office of Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios for producing [“racially discriminatory assessments and taxes.\"](https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-cook-county-board-assessor-berrios-met-20170718-story.html) The lawsuit included claims that the assessor’s office undervalued high-priced homes and overvalued low-priced homes, creating a visible divide along racial lines: Wealthy homeowners, who were typically white, [paid less in property taxes](https://www.clccrul.org/bpnc-v-berrios-facts?rq=berrios), whereas [working-class, non-white homeowners paid more](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-cook-county-assessor-berrios-sued-met-20171214-story.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chicago Tribune's four-part series, [\"The Tax Divide\"](https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-tax-divide-investigation-20180425-storygallery.html), delves into how this was uncovered: After \"compiling and analyzing more than 100 million property tax records from the years 2003 through 2015, along with thousands of pages of documents, then vetting the findings with top experts in the field,\" they discovered that \"residential assessments [had] been so far off the mark for so many years.\" You can read more about their investigation [here](https://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/cook-county-property-tax-divide/assessments.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the discrimination described in the lawsuit is built on a much deeper history - including the practice of redlining in Chicago. Though this is by no means a comprehensive history, Merriam-Webster defines redlining as the \"withholdding of home-loan funds or insurance from neighborhoods considered poor economic risks.\" The neighborhoods in this category, however, were typically comprised of Black communities; redlining, then, systemically prevented Black residents from moving into other neighborhoods and improving their current homes by denying them the financial assistance that white residents were afforded. Though the Fair Housing Act of 1968 outlawed redlining, its [impacts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/28/redlining-was-banned-50-years-ago-its-still-hurting-minorities-today/) and [practices](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-modern-day-redlining-20180215-story.html) are still present today.\n",
    "\n",
    "This context is vital to understanding how the Cook County Residential Sales Data - the dataset you'll be working with - was procured. This introduction aims to address how legacies of racial discrimination practices can be encoded within data, as well as consider how they might influence modeling choices."

    "When examining your data, it’s important to consider who collects the data in order to understand the assumptions and perspectives built into it. Here, the idea of desirable properties is influenced by what the real estate industry - a source of expertise in home valuations - deems popular with its market. These human choices about value are shaped by the real estate agents' expertise acquired through their professional training and experience. From a seller's perspective, this expertise also makes the agent's valuations legitimate and authoritative in a way that's difficult to contest. As a result, a form of professional bias enters into the valuation process, and though this bias isn’t inherently bad, we’ll delve deeper into how it interacts with, and often reinforces, structural inequity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue using `Site Desirability` as an example, let’s say that proximity to high-ranking schools adds to a home’s desirability. Because schools are largely funded by property taxes, high-ranking schools are typically located near homes in higher-income neighborhoods. Comparatively, homes in lower-income neighborhoods - with families predominantly from Hispanic and Black communities - would be deemed “less desirable” because they would not feed into high-ranking schools, further devaluing homes in lower-income neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, `Site Desirability` acts as a proxy for sensitive attributes, such as the racial distribution of a neighborhood. Although it does not explicitly name these attributes, `Site Desirability` ultimately encodes the broader socioeconomic and racial context of a home’s surrounding community. And because real estate agents affirm their classifications of `Site Desirability` based on their expertise, structural inequity is further perpetuated as this bias is embedded in the data used to generate housing valuation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding your dataset provides a lot of insight into how models might incorporate bias from the very beginning. A data scientist with this awareness would not only identify sources of bias, but also aim to intentionally address these biases in their data analyses, as well as the outputs and recommendations based on these analyses. As we progress through this homework, keep these perspectives on bias and expertise in mind."

Since `Roof Material` is a categorical variable, we will have to one-hot-encode the data.  Notice in the example code below that we have to pre-specify the categories.  Why? Imagine what would happen if we automatically generated the categories only from the training data.  What would happen if the testing data contained a category not found in the training set?  For more information on categorical data in pandas, refer to this [link](https://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/user_guide/categorical.html).\n",

    "**Note**: You should **avoid using `pd.get_dummies`** in your solution as it will remove your original column and is therefore not as reusable as your constructed data preprocessing pipeline. Instead, you can one-hot-encode one column into multiple columns **using Scikit-learn's [One Hot Encoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)**.\n",

In the meantime, consider the implications of your work so far: Given the history of racial discrimination in housing policy and property taxation, defining what a fair assessment entails is no easy feat. In addition to historical context, these assessments are a product of choices made at every level of the assessment process, from data collection to modeling. And the humans who make these choices - real estate agents, data scientists, county assessors, and, in this homework and the next, you - must understand the inputs to and consider the impacts of these decisions."
